# Youtube_analysis

📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **YouTube trending videos** across different regions to uncover patterns in viewership, content categories, and audience engagement.  
By combining **Python, SQL, and visualization tools (Tableau/Power BI/Seaborn/Matplotlib)**, we extract insights into what makes videos trend and how trends vary across countries.

 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and standardize YouTube trending datasets from multiple regions.
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on views, likes, dislikes, and comments.
- Use **SQL queries** to extract meaningful insights (e.g., top categories, average views).
- Apply **sentiment analysis** on video titles and tags.
- Build **time-series visualizations** for trending duration and publish patterns.
- Create **dashboards** to compare region-wise trends.

 Tools & Technologies
- **Python** → Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TextBlob (sentiment analysis)  
- **SQL (MySQL) → Data querying and aggregation  
- **Visualization** → Power BI / Python plots  
- **Jupyter Notebook** → Analysis and documentation

- 🚀 Outcomes
- Identified the **most engaging categories** (e.g., Music, Entertainment).  
- Discovered regional differences in trending content.  
- Showed that **positive sentiment titles** often correlate with higher views.  
- Built dashboards for **business stakeholders** to explore trends interactively.
